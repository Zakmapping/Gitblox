The Republic of Algeria discovered oil in Adrar and sent 100 oil exploration machines and we began to produce 2.3 million barrels per day. We also found gold, silver, iron, and many coal mines in the country. We established schools, hospitals, laboratories, and weapons factories. The legal age for joining the army is compulsory, which is 18 years due to the lack of soldiers. We raised taxes by 0.6% and the unemployment rate fell by 13%.
