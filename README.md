```

- Note: Do not take the minimum age on the game page as it is completely wrong. We want you to try it yourself and see because there are games like Condo that are mild and are originally banned and not allowed for any category. 

## Banned Games:
- Condo Games
- Sex Games
- Terrorism Games (isis games, etc...)

# Gitblox Developers: 
Now we start with the programmers section, which is a section dedicated to Roblox game programmers who are trying to build a better environment for Roblox for all age groups, and we offer you a lot of programming things. 

## Gitblox Developers Information: 
- The developing tools we provide do not violate Roblox's ToS. [If there is any harmful tool, you can report it to us so we can remove it as soon as possible.] 

- We do not want to violate the Roblox Creator Store rules and will present them to you in the next message: [for who wanna be contibutor]

### Gitblox Developers Contibutor Rules:
- You must check the software tool properly and carefully and make sure that these things are not present: 
```
loadstring()
```

```
require()
```

```
getgenv()
```

```
setfenv()
```

- Roblox allows (some tools) these things like HD Admin or F3X and this is normal (we only accept these things from people who have been verified by the Roblox staff, meaning that Roblox allows them to use that thing, so you can publish it)
